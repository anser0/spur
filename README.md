# SPUR 2023
This repository contains code written by Serena An and Holden Mui as part of a research project titled "Flip Graphs on Self-Complementary Ideals of Chain Products". The research was conducted under the mentorship of Elisabeth Bullock as part of the MIT math department's 2023 Summer Program in Undergraduate Research (SPUR). 

A description of each of the folders is as follows:

* [chainproducts](https://github.com/anser0/spur/tree/main/chainproducts) contains code to generate all self-complementary ideals of $[\ell_1]\times [\ell_2]\times [\ell_3]$ for small $\ell_i$.
* [cssc](https://github.com/anser0/spur/tree/main/cssc) contains code to generate all cyclically-symmetric ideals of $[2r]\times [2r]\times [2r]$, their eccentricities, and the ideals furthest from the unique element in the center for $r\le 4$.
* [data](https://github.com/anser0/spur/tree/main/data) contains select data from other files, such as all totally symmetric self-complementary ideals of $[2r]\times [2r]\times [2r]$ and their eccentricities for $r\le 4$.
* [graphvisualizer](https://github.com/anser0/spur/tree/main/graphvisualizer) contains code to generate and visually represent the flip graph on self-complementary ideals of chain products.
  * [graphvisualizer/images](https://github.com/anser0/spur/tree/main/graphvisualizer/images) contains images of the flip graphs of $[\ell_1] \times \dots \times [\ell_d]$ for all $\ell_1 \cdots \ell_d \leq 64$.
* [tssc](https://github.com/anser0/spur/tree/main/tssc) contains code to generate all totally symmetric self-complementary ideals of $[2r]\times [2r]\times [2r]$, their eccentricities for $r\le 6$, and the points that all totally symmetric self-complementary ideals must contain.
